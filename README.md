### CodSoft - Internship Project

### Python Projects Collection

  This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Python projects, each developed with unique functionalities and libraries. These projects are great for learning Python programming concepts, GUI design, and basic game logic. The collection includes:

  1. A Calculator built using tkinter for a graphical interface.
  2. A Password Generator that creates random, secure passwords.
  3. A Rock-Paper-Scissors Game with simple gameplay logic.

### Projects
  1. Calculator : A simple GUI calculator created using Python's tkinter library, which allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
  
    Features
      1. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
      2. User-friendly, responsive button layout.
      3. Error handling for invalid inputs.
  
  2. Password Generator : A password generator that creates strong, random passwords based on user-defined length. This script uses the random and string libraries to ensure high entropy and security in the generated passwords.
  
    Features
      1. Allows users to specify the desired password length.
      2. Generates passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
      
  3. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game : A console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game uses the random library to determine the computer's choice.
  
    Features :
      1. Interactive gameplay where users input their choice.
      2. Simple game logic that determines the winner and displays the result.
      3. Replay option for multiple rounds.
      
### Getting Started
  To run the game:
  ### Requirements : Each project was built with Python 3, and standard libraries are used:
    
      1.tkinter for GUI (Calculator)
      2.random for generating random choices (Password Generator & Rock-Paper-Scissors)
      3.string for character selection in password generation

### Usage :
Each project has individual files. Simply run each file using Python as specified above.
